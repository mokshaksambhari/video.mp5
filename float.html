        <b>The Sharingan :</b>
         (写輪眼, literally meaning: Copy Wheel Eye, meaning
         (Viz): Mirror Wheel Eye) is the dōjutsu kekkei genkai of the Uchiha
          clan thatppears selectively among its members.[1] It is regarded 
          s one of the "Three Great Dōjutsu", the others being the Byakugan and
           the Rinnegan.[2] While its powers originated from Kaguya Ōtsutsuki's
            Rinne Sharingan, its independent form was first manifested by Indra 
            Ōtsutsuki[3] (Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki in the anime).[4]

        <b>Madara Uchiha:</b>
        (Japanese: うちは マダラ, Hepburn: Uchiha Madara) is
         a manga and anime character in the Naruto series created by Masashi
          Kishimoto. He appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga 
          and the Shippuden anime adaptation, and serves as the supreme antagonist
           of the series. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, is one 
           of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn:
            Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power conflict
             over how to run the village, as well as the long-time feud between clans
             , leads to Madara deciding that humanity is beyond saving, and seeks to 
             cast a genjutsu on the entire planet that will eventually annihilate humanity
              and turn them into numerous variants of White Zetsu, with him the sole survivor.
               This leads to his defection and apparent death in a battle with Hashirama; however,
                it is revealed later that Madara secretly survived well into elderhood, and manipulates
                 main antagonist Obito Uchiha into laying the key for his future plans before his true death.
                  During most of the series, Madara serves simply as a posthumous background figure while 
                  Obito uses Madara's name to create aura around himself. This changes when Kabuto Yakushi 
                  reanimates the real Madara, who eventually defies Obito and becomes the primary threat for
                   the remainder of the series.

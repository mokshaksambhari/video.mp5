    <h1>MADARA UCHIHA</h1>
    <p>
        <b>Madara Uchiha:</b>
        (Japanese: うちは マダラ, Hepburn: Uchiha Madara) is
         a manga and anime character in the Naruto series created by Masashi
          Kishimoto. He appears for the first time in "Part II" of the manga 
          and the Shippuden anime adaptation, and serves as the supreme antagonist
           of the series. He, along with its first Hokage Hashirama Senju, is one 
           of the co-founders of Konohagakure (Japanese: 木ノ葉隠れの里, Hepburn:
            Konohagakure no Sato) village from the ninja world. Their power conflict
             over how to run the village, as well as the long-time feud between clans
             , leads to Madara deciding that humanity is beyond saving, and seeks to 
             cast a genjutsu on the entire planet that will eventually annihilate humanity
              and turn them into numerous variants of White Zetsu, with him the sole survivor.
               This leads to his defection and apparent death in a battle with Hashirama; however,
                it is revealed later that Madara secretly survived well into elderhood, and manipulates
                 main antagonist Obito Uchiha into laying the key for his future plans before his true death.
                  During most of the series, Madara serves simply as a posthumous background figure while 
                  Obito uses Madara's name to create aura around himself. This changes when Kabuto Yakushi 
                  reanimates the real Madara, who eventually defies Obito and becomes the primary threat for
                   the remainder of the series.

    <p><b>Itachi Uchiha</b>
      (うちは イタチ, Uchiha Itachi) is a character in the Naruto manga and anime series
       created by Masashi Kishimoto. Itachi is the older brother of Sasuke Uchiha, and 
       is responsible for killing all the elder members of their clan, sparing only Sasuke.
        He appears working as a terrorist from the organisation Akatsuki and serves as Sasuke's greatest enemy.

        During the second part of the manga, Itachi becomes involved in attacks to ninjas possessing tailed-beast 
        creatures (Jinchuriki) until facing Sasuke in a one-on-one battle. Although Itachi perishes during the final
         duel, it is later revealed that Itachi had a secret reason for assassinating the Uchiha clan. Itachi is a 
         playable character in most of the video games from the series. Itachi's character has been popular with readers
          of the manga[6] and has been positively received by critics. He is considered by many to be one of the best
           characters in the series. His appearance as an antagonist has been praised by several writers, although some
            have considered his initial appearance to be unsurprising. The gradual revelations of his past and its impact
             on the story has also received positive reception,[7][8] and his fights were noted to be "one of the best" in
              the series.[9][10][11] Numerous types of merchandise have been released in Itachi's likeness, including keychains
            , plush dolls and figurines.
